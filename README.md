## Analyzing Traffic Accident Data: Identifying Patterns and Contributing Factors üöóüí•

As part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I worked on a project to analyze and visualize traffic accident data to identify key patterns and contributing factors. Below is a summary of the key insights and visualizations:

## üîç Key Insights from the Data:

### Driver Demographics:
Young adults (18-30) and middle-aged adults (31-50) have the highest accident rates.
Male drivers are involved in the majority of accidents, which could point to higher risk-taking behavior or simply more male drivers on the road.
Drivers with lower education levels (junior high school and elementary) are more frequently involved in accidents, indicating potential road safety awareness issues.

### Driving and Vehicle Context:
Most accidents involve drivers with 2-10 years of driving experience, and company vehicle drivers are notably overrepresented in accidents.
This might point to challenges such as work-related pressure or reduced personal responsibility with company cars.

### Environmental Factors:
Two-way roads, especially those without proper markings, and Y-shaped junctions are hotspots for accidents.
Accidents tend to occur on asphalt roads during daylight, suggesting higher traffic volume in these conditions.
Normal weather conditions were found to contribute more to accidents than adverse weather conditions, emphasizing the need for safer driving behavior.

### Collision and Vehicle Movement Patterns:
The majority of accidents are vehicle-on-vehicle collisions and collisions with roadside objects, highlighting the need for better road designs and stricter adherence to traffic rules.
Most accidents happen while vehicles are going straight, possibly due to distractions or unsafe distances.

### Primary Causes of Accidents:
Common causes include careless lane changes and lack of distancing between vehicles. While alcohol and drug-related accidents are less frequent, they still pose a significant risk.

### Accident Severity:
Moderate severity (2) is the most common, followed by minor (1) and severe (0) accidents. While most accidents are non-fatal, they can still result in serious injuries or damage.

## üìä Visualizing the Data:
Using matplotlib and seaborn, I visualized key factors like accident severity, driver demographics, weather conditions, and vehicle movements. I created bar charts and other visualizations to identify patterns, such as high accident rates for specific age groups or types of road conditions.

I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to apply data analysis techniques on such a significant dataset and contribute to improving road safety.
